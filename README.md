## Usage Information

A note about existing BBCodes with the same name as a media site ID name (i.e. youtube): 
If you already have one of these, then your existing BBCode will take precedence over 
the one in this plugin. You may continue using your existing BBCode and this plugin will 
ignore any links from that site. 

You can delete the existing BBCode if you want this plugin to handle links from that site
instead. After you delete your old BBCode you must go to `Media Embed` -> 
`Manage Sites` and enable the site.

Note that by deleting the old BBCode your old posts may no longer render the videos 
and will display the deleted BBCode tags as text. Experiment with this on a local 
offline backup of your board first.

A full list of supported media sites can be found [here](https://s9etextformatter.readthedocs.io/Plugins/MediaEmbed/Sites/).
